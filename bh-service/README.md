#### **Bluehost Customer product order tracker service**
##### Background
The mail-order anvil business is slowing, and the Acme company has decided to join the modern world.
They’ve created a new Acme Web subsidiary, and it needs a web service for tracking customer products.
You have been hired to create a prototype for them to evaluate.

##### Prototype
The full prototype will support CRUD operations for customers, products, and orders. Each operation
validates its input before executing the requested action.

The company has two customer types (standard and premium). Premium customers do not pay shipping
and are eligible for a free order of Acme Aspirin once per month. Customer data is limited to name and
address.

The web service will initially support four basic products: anvils, super costumes, rocket-powered roller
skates, and aspirin. Basic product data is limited to name, price, description, and the number in stock.
Both the costumes and the roller skates are available in different sizes and colors, so they also need
these two pieces of data.

Order data is limited to the customer Id, the product Id, the quantity ordered, the shipping charge, and the
total price.

##### Deliverable
The single deliverable is the link to a GitHub repo containing both your code for the exercise and a
README file listing a) any assumptions you’ve made in designing your solution, and b) optionally, a list of
additional work you would have done had time permitted.

##### My Assumptions:
